And enables users to use fees and wallet abstraction to access any app or any chain without any hassle.<p />\\n\\n        Push Chain uses all these innovations to enable reading (shared state) or writing to different chains (programmable solvers), all controlled by the universal smart contract. The fee and wallet abstraction further enables a seamless, user centric approach as the learnings for a user is abstracted away no matter from what chain they chose to interact. <p/>\\n\\n        This results in **fully interoperable applications** for web3.
